# MLB-Project
This repository contains files from a project about Major League Baseball attendance and game length. 
The goal of the project was to assess whether the new pitch clock that the league implemented in 2023 has effectively reduced the length of games. Additionally, this analysis assessed whether length of games impacts attendance and how attendance in general has recovered since the COVID-19 pandemic.
