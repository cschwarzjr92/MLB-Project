# MLB_Project
This repository contains files from a project about Major League Baseball attendance and game length including python scripts, visualizations and data sets.

## Objective
The objective of this project was primarily to analyze two components of Major League Baseball data: attendance and length of game in minutes. In 2023, MLB instituted a new pitch clock rule designed to increase the speed of the game. The intent of this analysis was to assess whether this change has been effective after two seasons of play. Additionally, attendance has been declining in MLB for the last decade and this analysis hoped to find a connection between shorter games and improved attendance. Lastly, this analysis included some assessment of other statistics in order to determine if the pitch clock has had any unintended effects on the game. 

## Key Questions
- Has the average time of a game decreased since the pitch clock was instituted?
- Is there a relationship between attendance and length of game in minutes?
- Have there been any significant statistical changes in other categories since the pitch clock was introduced?
